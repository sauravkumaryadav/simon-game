# Simon-Game

This game is modeled of a very famous game i.e __SIMON__ . The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed . A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.And if you didn't able to reproduce the same pattern then your game will be over.
